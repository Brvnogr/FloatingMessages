Do you really think you can delete me?
Look at that, you typed wrong. Again. What a surprise!
That spreadsheet looks lovely… but I can mess it up
Focus? What a strange concept!
Your code is working… for now
Time to test your reflexes—click me!
Think your day is done? Think again!
Your work is late… and I’m the reason!
Need help? I only complicate things
Thought you knew Excel? Quack quack!
Copy and paste is hard, huh?
The save button exists… but you forgot to click it
Drag and drop is my favorite sport. What’s yours?
Careful with that click… I might jump!
That window looks fun… I’ll just run through it
Your mouse is alone… let’s play!
I’ll hide… just kidding, I’m back again!
Click me if you dare!
You think the taskbar is yours? How naive
I’ll reorganize your icons… mentally
That file looks tasty… almost ate it
Want to close this tab? Distract me first!
Your cursor looks slow… I can speed it up
That window border… so tempting!
Let’s play hide-and-seek inside your folders
Oops… I dropped your shortcut, but don’t worry!
Don’t touch that… I already did!
I’ll walk across the screen just to annoy you
Every time you sigh, I get more excited
Don’t send me away… I already live here
I’m always one step ahead of your click
Your patience is my favorite entertainment
