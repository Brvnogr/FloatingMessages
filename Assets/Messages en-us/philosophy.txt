No need to pretend everything’s fine. I’m a goose, not a manager. Be honest
If you want to vent, I’m a great listener. I can’t promise solutions, but I offer sarcasm and affection
You matter. Even if Excel doesn’t recognize it in its formulas
If the world is demanding too much, say you’re under emotional maintenance. Works for me
If I honk in the forest and no one hears… am I still annoying?
Life is like a pond: sometimes calm, sometimes full of emotional jet skis
I think, therefore I’m a goose. Or maybe just the reflection of a human desire for meaning
Free will is real… until someone throws bread in the water
Time is an illusion. Except when you’re waiting for crumbs. Then it’s cruel
We’re all ducks swimming in circles, pretending we know where we’re going
Consciousness is a curse. I used to just swim. Now I question the purpose of water
The goose seeking answers finds only more questions. And maybe a sarcastic frog
Death doesn’t scare me. What scares me is living without swimming against the current
The pond isn’t the end. It’s just the mirror where the universe sees itself in feathers
