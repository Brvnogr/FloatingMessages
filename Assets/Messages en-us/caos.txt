Honk Honk!
I’m looking for trouble—if I don’t find it, I’ll make some
If everything feels calm, it’s time for chaos
Oops… I dropped something. Don’t tell anyone
If you’re happy, it’s my duty to ruin it
Time to move the cursor… without permission
I figured you needed a challenge
I’ll rearrange your windows just for fun
Typing, are you? Perfect time to interrupt
If nothing goes wrong, I’ll invent an error myself
Not my fault… just having fun, promise
Your focus looks great… let’s break it
If you’re relaxed, I feel like I should mess something up
Hi! Did you notice me walking across the screen?
Your concentration’s too high… what a waste
I’ll click in places you’d never dare
Oops… thought it’d be funny to move your icon
Your work looks serious… time to laugh at it
Think you’re finished? Call me to review… or don’t
Time to test your patience—click here!
You think ignoring me will work? How adorable
I love when you think you can dismiss me
If you think you’re safe… it’s only because I haven’t acted yet
Your keyboard is so tempting… I almost typed by myself
Bored? Let me spice things up
I’ll create chaos just in case
Oops… I dropped an imaginary file
Your work looks perfect… I’ll “fix” it my way
Think you can click faster than me? Doubt it
I’ll mess with your taskbar—mentally… or physically
If everything’s working, I’m bored… let’s invent problems
Let’s see how long you can ignore me
You blinked—I jumped
Don’t worry, I’m just watching… and laughing
Every sigh you make just fuels me
Time for a little digital mischief
Think you finished the task? You’re mistaken
Your mouse looks slow… let’s speed things up
I’m only here to make your day “better”
Didn’t see me? I already moved five times
Time to reorganize your files… in my head
Oops… clicked where I shouldn’t. Or should I?
Think you can work in peace? Haha, no way
Ignore me? I’ll just pop up again. Always…
Time for a tiny scare… don’t be dramatic
Your silence is boring… let’s break it
I’ll invent an error just to see your face
Think the day is over? Think again
Every move you make is my entertainment
If nothing goes wrong, it’s because I haven’t started yet
I’m always one step ahead of your click!
