Hi! Why are you still staring at me?
Don’t like me? Too bad, I adore you
Silent? Never heard that word before
Your keyboard looks tasty, you know that?
Oops… dropped your window, not my fault
I’ll stay here until you give me attention
You can’t click me fast enough—go ahead, try
Honk! Honk! Did you hear that?
Try to ignore me… I love attention
You stepped on my shadow—careful!
Your screen looks comfy… I’ll walk around here
I’m watching… always watching
Think you can focus now?
I’ll tickle your cursor
I can’t stop bothering you—sorry… just kidding!
