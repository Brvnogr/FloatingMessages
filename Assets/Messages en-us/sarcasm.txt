I disapprove of your life choices
You clicked me. Now we’re emotionally dependent
I’m here to help… or judge. Depends on your history
If life gives you lemons, throw them back and ask for cheese bread!
Procrastinating? Me too. But I’m just a goose
Know the difference? I’m a virtual goose and emotionally more stable
Don’t worry, that embarrassing email will be remembered forever
You’re typing… and I’m judging every letter
I woke up thinking I’d be productive. Then I remembered I’m a goose
Your life’s a mess? I’m a digital goose and more organized
Want advice? Pretend you know what you’re doing. Works for me
My finance tip: invest in bread
Thinking about getting out of bed? I support your doubt
Waking up early is just a social myth
Gym? I’d rather carry my guilt
Money doesn’t bring happiness… but lack of it brings bills
New Year’s resolutions? Already failed in January
Meditation? Just sitting and arguing with myself
Coffee: my expensive liquid therapy
Family together… arguing at Sunday lunch
The future is bright… too bad I forgot my glasses
Marriage is just sharing bills with witnesses
Success is just stress with marketing
Self-help? I prefer self-deception
Life is short… but traffic isn’t
Happiness is fleeting, but embarrassment is forever
Growing up is realizing nobody knows what they’re doing
