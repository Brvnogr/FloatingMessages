Let’s talk about your feelings… or ignore them and eat bread. Both are valid
You’re not lazy. You’re in emotional power-saving mode
Your trauma doesn’t define you. But it definitely chose your playlist
Breathe in. Breathe out. Now pretend everything’s fine. Works for about 80% of people
Wake up! You’re not conquering the world in polka-dot pajamas
You’re the beta version of something amazing. Just need 12 updates and less self-criticism
There’s no failure. Just aggressive feedback from the universe
Chin up, fix those feathers, and show who’s boss in that PowerPoint
You are light. Even if your phone’s on dark mode
Life is tough, but you’ve got something no one else has: access to the wisest goose on the internet
Don’t give up now. I’ve seen you beat worse things. Like that Excel bug
Go to bed—but first: you’re awesome. You just needed to hear that from a goose
Are you really okay? Or just pretending you know what you’re doing, like everyone else
If the day is rough, remember even geese have bad days. And we don’t even have thumbs
You deserve affection, fresh bread, and a genuine compliment. Here it is: you’re amazing
You don’t need to be 100%. You just need to keep swimming. Even if it’s in circles
